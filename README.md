### Description

Email marketing is a powerful marketing channel, a form of direct marketing as well as digital marketing, that uses email to promote your business's products or services. It can help make your customers aware of your latest items or offers by integrating it into your marketing automation efforts.

This particular email marketing campaign was used for Industria Veterinaria S. de R.L. for promotions of the Product BRAVECTO.

It also kills lone star ticks for eight weeks. Presented in a highly palatable flavored chew that dogs accept readily.

Email marketing is the act of sending a commercial message, typically to a group of people, using email. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing.
